This file describes modifications to an installed Cygwin-hosted toolchain which
enable it to be ported to and used on a non-Cygwin Window PC.

I install toolchains to c:/cross/arm-whatever-eabi.

After building and installing GCC using ct-ng:

Fix Windows security settings on the install directory so that changes can be made. 

Copy cygwin1.dll and cyggcc_s-seh-1.dll to ./bin.

Copy omp.h to ./lib/gcc/arm-multi-eabi/11.2.0/include (update path as needed).

Delete empty ./include

Create ./usr

Move ./libexec to ./usr.

Copy ./arm-multi-eabi to ./usr.
